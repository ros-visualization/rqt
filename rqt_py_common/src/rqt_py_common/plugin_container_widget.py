    """
    This widget accommodates a plugin widget that needs an area to show system
    message. A plugin widget is the pane that provides plugin's main
    functionalities. PluginContainerWidget visually encapsulates a plugin
    widget.

    In order to print msg in the msg pane provided by this class, plugin widget
    MUST define and emit following signals:

    - sig_sysmsg
    - sig_progress

    Having said that this architecture is based on signals, it is recommended
    that exceptions raised in classes that are used in a plugin widget be
    aggregated in it, so that only plugin widget is responsible for emitting
    signals.
